Notes :

Basic requirment to test a browser application :
Browser, Context, Page


Definition :

Browser-
A browser is a software application that allows users to access and interact with web pages on the internet. 
Examples include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari. Browsers interpret HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to render web pages visually for users.

Context (Window)-
A context in Playwright is an isolated environment within a browser instance. It allows you to create multiple independent sessions, each with its own cookies, local storage, and cache. This is useful for testing scenarios that require different user states or configurations without interference.

Page -
A page in Playwright represents a single tab or window within a browser context. It is where you interact with web content, perform actions like clicking buttons, filling forms, and navigating between pages. Each page operates independently within its context.


Classroom activity :
--------------------
1. Launch a browser and load URL in chromium and firefox browser.

DOM structure
-------------

DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. 
It represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds to an element in the HTML document. 
The DOM allows developers to manipulate the content, structure, and style of a web page dynamically using programming languages like JavaScript.

DOM - Document Object Model

HTML - HyperText Markup Language

Basics 
------
Tags - instructions - enclosed within the angle brackets
Attributes - additional information about the element - always in name/value pair
Elements - complete structure from start tag to end tag
Text - content within the element

<html>
<head>
    <title> Amazon India </title>
</head>
<body>
<div>
  <span>
    <input> 
    </input>
  </span>
</div>

Methods to locate an element on a web page :
-----------------------------
- CSS Selector
- Xpath Selector
- Playwright locators ( inbuilt methods)
 
 CSS Selector -

- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) selectors are patterns used to select and style HTML elements on a web page. 
- They allow you to target specific elements based on their attributes, such as 
* ID, 
* Class, 
* Other attribute type, or position in the DOM (Document Object Model) hierarchy.

- CSS selectors are commonly used in web development and testing to apply styles or interact with elements.


Classroom activity :
--------------------

Salesforce login page :
--------------------
1. Using CSS selector to enter username
2. Using CSS selector to enter password
3. Using CSS selector to click on login button

Username : ravindran.ramdas@testleaf.com
Passord : RaviSalesforce#1234
Xpath Selector -

- XPath (XML Path Language) is a query language used to navigate and select nodes in an XML document.
- In web development and testing, XPath is often used to locate elements on a web page based on their hierarchical structure and attributes.
- XPath expressions can be absolute (starting from the root) or relative (starting from a specific  element).
































Maximize Screen size in chromium : 
--------------------------------

  {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: { browserName:"chromium", 
        viewport:null, // disable the deafult 1280x720
        launchOptions:{
          args:['--start-maximized'],
        },
      },
    }, 



Maximize Screen size in firefox : 
--------------------------------

     {
      name: 'firefox',
      use: { browserName:"firefox", 
        viewport:{ width: 1920, height: 1080 }, // disable the deafult 1280x720
        launchOptions:{
          args:['--start-maximized'],
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†}
}
