📑 **Agenda for Week 7 Day 1: OOPs in TypeScript

🎯 [Focus: Mastering Object-Oriented Programming Concepts in TypeScript]

📆 [30th Aug Saturday]

🕝 Session Highlights

⿡ Recap
Quick review of previous learnings.

⿢ Class & Objects

Understanding the basics of classes and objects in TypeScript.
Examples: Creating and using classes and objects.

⿣ Constructors

Role of constructors in initializing objects.
Examples: Using parameterized and default constructors.

⿤ Access Modifiers

Understanding public, private, and protected access modifiers.
Examples: Controlling access to class properties and methods.

⿥ Inheritance

Exploring the concept of inheritance for code reuse.
Examples: Implementing single and multilevel inheritance.

🕡 Wrap Up / Q&A

📝 Keep your physical notebook and pen handy to sketch out ideas and test workflows!


Agenda :

1. Class and Object.
2. Method and properties.
3. Constructor.
4. Accessmodifiers.
5. Polymorphism.
6. Inheritance.


class:
Design/ template to build object.

property :Informartion of thst particular page

method : action performed on that page.


class CarInnova {
//properties:Informartion of thst particular page
properties : string

//methods:action performed on that page.
method(){
properties
}
}

let variableNameFeature1 = new CarInnova() // Object creation //variableNameFeature1 is the object


AccessModifiers:
---------------

1. public : can be accessed inside and outside of the class
2. protected: can be accessed inside the class as well as the related class --> relationship--> inherit
3. private: not accessible outisde the class --> give permission to access or to rewrite "get" and "set"

4. readonly: constant/final --> cannot change the assigned value
5. static: belongs to the class rather than the object

Method Overloading :
------------------

Method overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, but different parameters (different type or number of parameters).

Method Overriding :

Method overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass or parent class.


Inheritance :
--------------

1. Single Inheritance :

classA{}
classB extends A{}

2. Multilevel Inheritance :

class A{}

class B extends A{}
class C extends B{}

3. Hierarchical inheritance 

class A{}

class B extends A{}
class C extends A{}

4. Hybrid Inheritance

A combination of two or more types of inheritnace (e.x : multilevel and Hierarchical)


5. Multiple Inheritance
Typescript does not support multiple inheritnace using classes.
Can be achieved through interface.



faker library installation :

npm install @faker-js/faker


Trouble shooting :

If you get error like below :

Property 'empName' has no initializer and is not definitely assigned in the constructor

Install tsconfig package:

npm install typescript --save-dev 

or

npx tsc --init

Then make chages in tsconfig.json file or initial the value to ""
