📑 Agenda for Week 6 Day 2: Advanced Playwright Interactions
🎯 Focus: Exploring Advanced Features for Enhanced Playwright Automation

📆 Date: 19 Oct. [Sunday]

1. Hooks Test Annotation
* Different test annotation used as part of testcase execution.

2. Test Annotations
* Enhancing test readability and control using annotations.
* Examples: Skipping, focusing, or tagging specific tests.

3. Storage State (Skip Login)  
* Utilizing storage state to bypass login during test execution.  
* Practical examples: Reducing redundant authentication steps. 

4.  Persistent Context (Non-incognito mode)
* Maintaining login/session state across test runs using user data directories.
* Real-world example: Avoid repeated logins for authenticated flows.

5. Visual Regression Testing
* Capturing and comparing UI snapshots to detect unintended changes.
* Use cases: Ensuring consistent UI across versions and devices.

6.  Geolocation
* Simulating geolocation data for location-based testing.
* Practical use cases: Testing location-restricted functionalities.

6. Device Emulation
* Emulating various devices and screen resolutions in Playwright.
* Practical examples: Testing responsive designs and mobile-specific features.

7. Codegen (Code Generation)
* Auto-generating Playwright scripts by recording user interactions.
* Benefits: Faster test creation and onboarding for beginners.


# Test Annotation :
---

--> Control the behaviour of the execution.

hooks -> The execution flow before and after the actual test execution.
------
test.beforeAll --> before all test it will be executed
test.beforeEach --> before each test it will be executed
test.afterEach -->  after each test it will be executed
test.afterAll --> after all test it will be executed

Other Test Annotation
---

test.only --> focus on a specific test.
test.skip --> ignore the test from execution
test.fixme --> track and know failures that are yet tp be fixed
test.fail --> for negative testing --> test has to fail is the expectation
test.slow --> double the timeout of the tests execution --> 30 s --> 60 s for the entire test execution
test.describe --> grouping the test depending on the status of the other test.
test.use -->use the functionalities

npm uninstall xlsx

npm install xlsx-js-style

This should be in your code :

import XLSX from "xlsx-js-style"
