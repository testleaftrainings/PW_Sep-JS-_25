📑 Agenda for Week 8 Day 2: OOPs in Framework

🎯 Focus: Mastering Object-Oriented Programming Concepts in TypeScript

📆 02st Nov, Sunday

🕝 Session Highlights

⿡ Recap
Quick review of previous learnings.

⿢Inheritance
Exploring the concept of inheritance for code reuse.
Examples: Implementing single and multilevel inheritance.

⿥POM (Page Object Model)
Design pattern to enhance test maintainability and reusability.
Examples: Creating page classes and using them in test cases.

⏸ \[Break / Practice]

⿤Polymorphism
Understanding method overriding and runtime behavior.
Examples: Creating multiple forms of behavior from a single interface.

⿣ Abstraction
Using abstract classes and methods to define templates.
Examples: Designing partially implemented base classes.



Inheritance :

1. Single Inheritance :
When a class inherits another class

classA{} // 01-accessModifiers.ts --> Base class
classB extends A{} // 02-accessModifiersPro.ts extends 01-accessModifiers.ts

2. Multilevel Inheritance :
When a class inherits another class which is already inherited from another class

class A{}

class B extends A{}
class C extends B{}

3. Hierarchical inheritance 
 When multiple classes inherits a single class

class A{}

class B extends A{}
class C extends A{}

4. Hybrid Inheritance
A combination of two or more types of inheritnace (e.x : multilevel and Hierarchical)


5.Multiple Inheritance
When a derived class inherits more than one parent class

Typescript does not support multiple inheritnace using classes.
Can be achieved through interface.

Page Object Model :

POM means:

Each web page (or module) of your application is represented by a separate class,
and that class contains locators and methods that act on that page.

login--> welcome page --> home page --> LeadPage -->CreatLead --> viewLead
                                                ---> findLead --> VieLead --> Edit
                                                ----> MergeLead
                                    
                                    
                                    ---> Account Page -->CreatAccount --> viewAccount
                                                ---> findAccount --> ViewAccount--> Edit
                                                ----> MergeAccount
Pages :

login page :
Username, Password and login

welcome page :
crmsfa and logout

homePage :
leads, accounts, contact , opportunities..

leadPage :
createLead , findLead

CreateLeadPage :
manadatoryFields

ViewPage :
Get the inner text of the created.

Tests
1. CreateLead.spec.ts
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Interface :
-----------------

- Complete hiding of the implemented.
- 100% abstraction.
- Only unimplemented methods.

Summarize 

- class extends another class
- abstract extends another abstract class
- interface extends another interface
- class extends abstract class
- class implements interface
- class extends abstract class im plemnets interface

We cannot see implementation of your page fixture, context browser in playwright everytging is put in as interface

2. Abstraction
----------------- 

abstract class :

- 0 to 100% abstraction.
- Method signature --> unimplementedmethods
- Implemented methods --> logic 


Method Overloading :
------------------

Method overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, but different parameters (different type or number of parameters).

Method Overriding :
-------------------

Method overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass or parent class.
