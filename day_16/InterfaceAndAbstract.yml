##  **Franchise Business Analogy for Abstract Class & Interface**

Imagine your brand runs on franchise model.

Have multiple franchise outlets — Chennai, Bangalore, Delhi —
each owned by local managers but following brand rules.

---

### 🧩 **1️⃣ Interface → The Brand Rulebook 📘**

The **Head Office** gives a **franchise agreement** (rulebook).
It says:

> “Every outlet **must** have these things:
>
> * a `makeBurger()` method 
> * a `serveCustomer()` method 
> * a `generateBill()` method ”

But it doesn’t say **how** to make or serve —
that’s up to each outlet!

---

#### 💻 **In Playwright:**

```ts
export interface IFranchiseRules {
  makeBurger(): void;
  serveCustomer(): void;
  generateBill(): void;
}
```

✅ **Purpose:**

* Ensures every outlet (page class) follows the **same structure**.
* The brand (framework) can rely on these methods being available everywhere.

---

### 🧩 **2️⃣ Abstract Class → The Brand Template 🏗️**

The head office also provides a **Base Setup** —
it already includes common facilities:

* Kitchen setup 
* Billing counter 
* Cleaning schedule 

But they say:

> “You must define your own menu and customer experience.”

So the **BaseFranchise** (abstract class) gives **common behavior** + **some parts to fill in**.

---

#### 💻 **In Playwright:**


✅ **Purpose:**

* Gives common reusable actions (open, close).
* Forces each child class (franchise outlet) to define its `menuItems()` (page-specific logic).

---

### 🧩 **3️⃣ Franchise Outlets → Page Classes 🏪**

Now each outlet (franchise branch) **inherits** from the brand’s setup and **implements** the rules.


✅ **Purpose:**

* Follows both the **brand rulebook (interface)** and **base design (abstract class)**.
* Still has its **own flavor** or customization.
